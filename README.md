# Personal SD Card Automation
üíª A simple, yet personal SD Card Automation which grabs files from folders and copies them to the SD Card.

You may modify the code to your preferences, and even use it with USBs, SSDs and HDDs

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This Automation is built for MacOS, so you may need to tweak the code in order to get it working on your machine.**

# For Example:
* Making sure that the correct ``/volumes`` folder is used. On Windows it may be different 
* Making sure to select the right name of your SD Card or other means of storage
